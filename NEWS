Changes currently in git
------------------------

* Less undefined and implementation-defined behavior, so libbmpread should work
  in more exotic environments.  I believe the only requirement for the runtime
  environment now is that CHAR_BIT == 8, which is hard to avoid.
* To that end, the flags have been changed to unsigned ints (they were ints).
  This may require some code changes in consumers of this API.
* Some formatting, wording, and packaging tweaks.

1.1 (2005 Mar. 15)
------------------

* Added byte-swapping code for big-endian machines (bmpread will now work on
  Macs!).  Thanks to Micah Tomblin for testing this for me.

1.0 (2005 Mar. 14)
------------------

* Initial version.
