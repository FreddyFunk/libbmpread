libbmpread
==========

libbmpread is an extremely portable, simple, robust, and lightweight
replacement for the auxDIBImageLoad and related device-independent bitmap
(.bmp) image loader functions of glaux, but it goes far beyond just that. At
the basic level, it's a flexible bitmap loader and decoder that can be used
anywhere you need to get the color data of a .bmp file.

Why create libbmpread when it's just duplicating existing functionality?
  - glaux.h and glaux.lib (or libglaux.a) no longer exist on most systems: a
    new solution is needed.
So, then why not use an existing image loading library?
  - There aren't very many full-featured and portable image libraries that are
    lightweight enough to be useful (libbmpread is two files: one .c and one .h
    that can be easily dropped into any existing project).
But why bitmaps?
  - Bitmaps are fairly common in simple games (that is, games where a drop-in
    image loader is called for) and easy to work with.


Features
--------
 - Handles uncompressed monochrome, 16 color, 256 color, and 24-bit bitmap
   files of any size.
 - Flexible output formats: dword or byte aligned scan-lines, last line first
   (upside-down) or linear.
 - Default behavior is compatible with OpenGL's texture functions.
 - Extremely lightweight, yet powerful and portable.
 - Written in 100% ANSI C, tested (and working!) on Win32, Linux, and MacOS X.
 - zlib licensed, so it can be used for pretty much anything on earth.


More Info
---------
For a quick tutorial on how to use libbmpread, see tutorial.html in this
distribution.

Visit the libbmpread webpage at http://chaoslizard.sourceforge.net/glbmp/ for

Email me at chaz@chazomatic.us with questions, bug reports, etc.

To see libbmpread in action download my cross-platform Asteroids clone from
http://chaoslizard.sourceforge.net/asteroid/ -- all textures (all one of 'em)
are loaded using libbmpread.


Changes
-------
v1.1 (2005 Mar. 15):
 - Added byte-swapping code for big-endian machines (libbmpread will now work
   on Macs!).  Thanks to Micah Tomblin for testing this for me.

v1.0 (2005 Mar. 14):
 - Initial version, supporting 1-, 4-, 8- and 24-bit uncompressed files.
